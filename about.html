<p> We started this business in 2017 by selling cheese popia, overtime our business gain more popularity especially with our customer who likes cheesey popia 
    <br>First we started off with just a small basic cheese popia, now currently in just 6 years in business we have released about 2 new flavour, which is cheesey 
    <br>spicy popia and plain crispy popia, the reason on why we rarely release new flavour is that we want to keep the authenticity and original root of our product 
    <br>especially our customer main reason as to why they buy it is that they want to eat our cheese popia. </p>
 <br>
    <p>Our business  also uses natural ingredients that do not contain preservatives in order to maintain quality and our customer satisfaction, not only that we also 
        <br>prioritise our customer satisfaction, thus it is why all of our products is sealed properly in order to maintain quality. Our factory is in Kajang.
